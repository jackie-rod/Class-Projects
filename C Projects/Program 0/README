# General Information
The program assignment asked to count the frequency of alphabet letters and
five cases of special words. This program required students to search through
given data files to the target frequencies.

FILE DOCUMENTATION______________________________________________________________

##count.h
- includes definitions for alphabet size and special word list size
- sets up headers for alphabetlettercount and special count functions
-------------------------------


##specialcount.c
Goal: The specialcharcount function counts the frequency of the following 5 special words:
"he"   "she"   "they"    "him"    "me"
in all the .txt files under directory of the given path and write the results to a file named as filetowrite.
Input:

  path - a pointer to a char string [a character array] specifying the path of the directory; and
  filetowrite - a pointer to a char string [a character array] specifying the file where results should be written in.
  charfreq - a pointer to a long array storing the frequency of the above 5 special words

  charfreq[0]: the frequency of "he"
  charfreq[1]: the frequency of "she"
  charfreq[2]: the frequency of "they"
  charfreq[3]: the frequency of "him"
  charfreq[4]: the frequency of "me"
Output: a new file named as filetowrite with the frequency of the above 5 special words written in
character -> frequency

example:
he -> 20
she -> 11
they -> 20
him -> 11
me -> 12

- I wrote this function using array for each special word. For every new word
under 6 index spaces the program will check if it matches any special words.
-------------------------------


##alphabetcount.c

Goal: The alphabetlettercount function counts the frequency of each alphabet letter (A-Z a-z, case sensitive) in all the .txt files under
directory of the given path and write the results to a file named as filetowrite.

Input:
  path - a pointer to a char string [a character array] specifying the path of the directory; and
  filetowrite - a pointer to a char string [a character array] specifying the file where results should be written in.
  alphabetfreq - a pointer to a long array storing the frequency of each alphabet letter from A - Z a - z:
  alphabetfreq[0]: the frequency of 'A'
  alphabetfreq[1]: the frequency of 'B'
     ... ...
  alphabetfreq[25]:the frequency of 'Z'
  alphabetfreq[26]:the frequency of 'a'
     ...  ...
  alphabetfreq[51]:the frequency of 'z'

Output: a new file named as filetowrite with the frequency of each alphabet letter written in
 letter -> frequency

 example:
 A -> 200
 B -> 101

 -I wrote this function by using ascii to determine where in the array the letters
 and the position of the letters should be used.
-------------------------------


##testalphabetcount.c
Goal: Print the frequencies of alphabetical characters stored in array: charfreq[] to output screen in the format as:
letter -> frequency (one letter a line)
Input: charfreq - array having the frequency of each alphabet letter
size     - the total number of alphabet letters
example:
a -> 20
b -> 30
-------------------------------


#testspecialcount.c
Goal: This function prints the frequency stored in array charfreq[] to output screen.
Input: charfreq - array having the frequency of special words
          size     - the total number of special words
example:
he -> 20
she -> 30
